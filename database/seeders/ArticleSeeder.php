            'subtitle' => 'Necessary Evil',
            'content' => "Tatsuki Fujimoto's electrifying shonen horror series Chainsaw Man has taken the anime and manga community by storm with its intense devil-hunting action colorful cast of characters. While Denji, Power, and Aki Hayakawa have become overwhelmingly popular as Chainsaw Man's main trio, there is another character who's quickly become a viral sensation -- the charming, soft-spoken antagonist, Makima.

            Makima's allure is apparent from the moment she's introduced. She's a conventionally attractive young woman with striking eyes and a voice that lulls Denji into a feeling of safety and security he had never experienced before. While there are cracks in her mild-mannered persona that become evident from her introduction, its difficult not to trust, and even become enamored with Makima's seemingly kind and loving demeanor.

            Stated by series creator Tatsuki Fujimoto during an interview with Shueisha, Makima was always meant to exist as a motherly figure to Denji -- someone that he is constantly trying to win the approval of. During the interview, Fujimoto said this about Makima's name, \"By the way, isn't a chainsaw originally a tool to cut wood? If you cut the 'ki' out of Makima, you get 'Mama'. Denji has always been pursuing maternal things.\"

            This unique characterization of Makima automatically makes her true intentions more sinister, Denji cannot fathom that his biggest threat is the one person he wants to acknowledge him more than anyone else. This also makes Makima's identity as the Control Devil more compelling. Her kind, motherly actions towards the other devil hunters makes them feel as though they are indebted to her, making them easier to manipulate, and ultimately dominate. Makima's character and true identity distorts the traditional idea of what a mother figure should be like, while still allowing her to appear honest and good-natured for a majority of Chainsaw Man's story.

            A fact often brought up by longtime Chainsaw Man fans that can be easily overlooked is a panel from Chapter 61 of the original manga. In a haunting panel, Kishibe holds up a notepad that simply reads, \"Makima is listening.\" While Kishibe verbally discusses mundane life updates to Quanxi, such as old age and retirement plans, he illustrates a plan through writing requesting Quanxi's assistance in killing the Control Devil once and for all.

            This moment not only offers a bone-chilling twist, but also infers that from the very beginning of the series, Makima has been keeping tabs on every major moment from the moment she discovers Denji. Considering her obsession the Chainsaw Devil, it can easily be inferred that much of this monitoring has been focused on Denji's activities. This is hinted at in Chapter 52, when, after offering Reze an opportunity to come back and see him in the café where they first met, Makima quickly intercepts her in an alleyway -- answering Reze's \"town mouse versus country mouse\" question she asked Denji during a private conversation between the two.

            These small moments illustrate a more threatening, domineering side to Makima. Being the Control Devil, her objective is to maintain as much power over Denji as possible, not because she cares for the young Devil Hunter, but because she wants access to the Chainsaw Devil. And, as Chainsaw Man progresses, she begins to isolate Denji from the people he grows to care about, making him even more dependent on her.

            In Chapter 81 of Chainsaw Man, Makima takes a moment to explain that there exist a group of Devils who have the ability to remember every Devil devoured by the Chainsaw Devil -- a mysterious lot ominously titled \"The Four Horseman\". As a reference to the Four Horseman of the Apocalypse from Christian scriptures: Death, War, Hunger, and Conquest -- represented by the Control Devil -- these powerful Devils are implied to be almost as powerful, if not on par, with the Primal Fears.

            This is notable, as in the battle against the Darkness Devil, Makima is able to wound him at the cost of just her arm. It also seems as though Makima planned to eradicate her fellow Horsemen, as she fully intended to take advantage of the Chainsaw Devil's powers to destroy all of them, despite having previously battled with them against Pochita. There is further symbolism tying Makima to the Four Horseman before the official reveal, such as her name being the same as the Conquest Devil in Japanese -- domination, or \"shihai\" -- and a small nod to a different interpretation of the first Horseman, pestilence, as Makima is shown teleporting herself with rats, animals commonly associated with disease and plagues.

            Although introduced as a soft-spoken and kind young woman, Makima is slowly revealed to be Denji's biggest adversary throughout Chainsaw Man. From her suave manipulation tactics and raw power, Makima is a formidable and terrifying antagonist that has easily become one of the greatest shonen villains of all time. Her beauty and subtle methods of control have captivated anime and manga fans, and will likely continue to do so long after Chainsaw Man concludes.

            'subtitle' => 'Mappa\'s Most Anticipated Anime Yet',
            'content' => "Chainsaw Man hit bookstore shelves in 2018 and immediately caught the attention of readers around the world. The violence, bloodshed, and subversions of shonen tropes captivated readers, and in 2021, the series became the 7th best-selling manga series that year. As of June 2022, the series sold over 13-million copies worldwide, and that number is expected to rise once the anime adaptation begins. Despite the first part of the story reaching its conclusion, Chainsaw Man's popularity and reception amongst audiences has made it an instant classic.

            After concluding his first serialized manga series, Fire Punch, in January 2018, Tatsuki Fujimoto was back at work to deliver another exhilarating series for his audience. Much like Fire Punch, Chainsaw Man presents itself as a dark fantasy packed with violent action and dark comedy. Fans of the series were quick to discover that what laid dormant beyond the continuous action was a bittersweet narrative, where the true pulse of its power took the spotlight. Chainsaw Man won the Best Shōnen Manga award at the 66th Shogakukan Manga Awards and the 27th at Manga Barcelona, as well as Best Manga at the Harvey Awards in 2021.

            The story of Chainsaw Man follows a young man named Denji who is tasked with paying off his father's debt to the yakuza by working as a Devil Hunter. Those with the title of Devil Hunter seek out, hunt, and exterminate devils that wreak havoc on Earth. Denji is soon betrayed by his yakuza employers, and in order to save his life, his companion Pochita merges with Denji, becoming his heart and turning him into the eponymous Chainsaw Man.

            Denji soon becomes wrapped up with Makima, a high-ranking public service Devil Hunter, taking on dangerous jobs to wipe out Devils that threaten the safety of Japan. He quickly becomes acquainted with fellow Devil Hunters, and even Devils themselves, changing his once very simple life forever. In time, Denji begins to discover that all is not quite what it seems.

            Chainsaw Man has thus far been collected into eleven volumes, completing the \"Public Safety Arc\". Part 2 of the series, simply titled \"School Arc\" began serializing in July 2022. While little is known about how much the anime will adapt, Chainsaw Man is expected to be divided into two cours, with an estimated twenty-four episodes. This gives studio MAPPA ample opportunity to cover the first 52 chapters, leading to the conclusion of the Bomb Devil Arc Fans of Chainsaw Man are in for a treat with MAPPA producing the anime release, following their phenomenal work on beloved series such as Attack on Titan and Jujutsu Kaisen.",

            'title' => 'Joker\'s Psychology',
            'subtitle' => 'Into the Mind of Arthur Fleck',
            'content' => "The Joker is a villain that both fascinates and terrifies us. His origin has remained relatively mysterious, sparking questions about how a “psycho killer” is created. Using real methods and theory, clinical expert Dr. Andrea Letamendi examines several portrayals of the Clown Prince of Crime, including Jack Nicholson in 1989’s Batman, Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight, and Mark Hamill in Batman: The Animated Series. Given the raised concerns causing tension to surround the new film, Joker (2019), considerations are given to the science behind behavioral threat assessment, case study, and occurrences of real events in an effort to responsibly inform the discourse.  The author wishes to note to readers that this collection of psychological profiles includes some references and descriptions of both real and fictional portrayals of mass violence, intimate partner abuse, and suicide. Just like the Joker, these conceptualizations are fictional and are not meant to diagnose any real person. This series is not intended as a substitute for the medical or mental health advice of psychiatrists or other clinical professionals.

                Arthur Fleck, played by Joaquin Phoenix in the solo origin story film Joker (2019) is an impoverished, scraggy middle-aged man who works as a party clown in the crime-riddled city of Gotham. Arthur is significantly underweight, his face sunken and pallid; and although he isn’t repulsive, his untidy, bizarre appearance is off-putting to others. Behaviorally, too, Arthur is odd. He is withdrawn and anti-social, but does not seem to be inherently callous or devious. In fact, Arthur is somewhat innocent and initially well-meaning toward others, especially children. Arthur lives with his mother, Penny, who he cares about deeply, but maintains no other strong, meaningful connections. His communication skills are generally poor; he may hold his gaze too long at someone, use abnormal body posturing or facial expressions, or miss important interpersonal cues, which cause others to be upset or discomforted around him. In his line of work as a cheap party clown, Arthur’s oddities are amplified. In many ways, Arthur is a product of interactionalsocialization; his peculiarities influence others to ostracize, bully, or avoid him, which in turn, lead him to isolate, grow weirder, and inevitably miss opportunities to improve his social skills.

                This Joker is not inherently provocative. In fact, when we’re introduced to him, Arthur has little insight in how he comes across to others. He’s generally aware that he is odd, but does not quite grasp the degree to which others find him unsettling. Quite the contrary, Arthur dreams of winning the adoration of others by becoming a successful stand-up comedian. He believes his purpose in life is to instill happiness in others—his overactive fantasies depict his mother as his number one support: “you were put on this earth to spread joy and laughter,” he imagines her saying to him adoringly. Arthur fantasizes of being in the spotlight, basking in the glow of show lights, approval, and applause. At times, he even closes his eyes and slowly dances to the sound of imaginary music; picturing himself as the center of attention, a popular figure like the famous talk-show host, Murray Franklin: visible, idolized, and respected. As he pantomimes the scene, Arthur envisions himself as charming, masculine, and dominant. Despite these uplifting dreams, Arthur’s actual life as a loner is monotonous, repetitive, unrewarding, and—much like the landscape of the Gotham City—hopelessly bleak.

            'subtitle' => 'Valorant is Approved by the Country',
            'content' => "The National Press and Publication Administration in China announced that Riot Games’ VALORANT will be available to play in the country, it was announced today. 

                VALORANT, alongside another five titles by Riot Games-owned Chinese conglomerate Tencent, was approved by the video game regulatory body, meaning that gamers in the country will finally have access to the game. 

                Until now, players had to use a virtual private network and connect to the Hong Kong servers to play the game. Despite the restrictions, plenty of professional teams flourished, such as EDward Gaming, which attended Champions earlier this year. 

                China’s video game market took a hit due to last August’s temporary suspension of video game licenses in the country. Even prior to the ban, the Chinese government implemented strict measures that limited the time young people could spend on video games. 

                The harsh restrictions have seen children spend less time on video games in China, with the research firm CNG alongside the China Game Industry Group Committee praising the measures taken, according to a November report by CNBC. 

                China is one of the major market players for video game companies, with Riot benefitting from the game’s 27 servers in China, which has allowed millions of players to access the title. The regulatory change means that players should now be able attain access to their own servers without having to utilize a virtual private network, but this remains in the air.
